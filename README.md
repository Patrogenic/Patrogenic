I am a web developer familar with Node, Express, MongoDB, JS, CSS, HTML, Digital Ocean, and related development tools such as webpack. I'm a firm believer that the more knowledgeable someone is, especially on the right topics, the better off they will be. And so I don't mind the grind. There's always a reward on the other side.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things software, but am primarily focused on the web at the moment. I like learning and reading books. I like to journal and reflect and think.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:  
-Web design principles. I feel like this is a weak point of mine and projects are judged at a glance by how they look.  
-How to become more comfortable using organizational principles (SOLID) so I can take advantage of more code reuse and better organized code.  
-How to make unit testing a habit  
-Vue
